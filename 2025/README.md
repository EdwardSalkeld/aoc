# 2025 Advent of code

![stars](https://github.com/EdwardSalkeld/aoc/blob/main/2025/2025.png?raw=true)

Initial pass done in Python.
Day 9-part2 was a 30m run (that did give the correct answer) until I learned about coordinate compressions.
Day 10-part2 was ... hard. My scipy solution is basically lifted from someone else's.
All the rest done without any tips or hints at all.
Much of the code is gross. But it got stars!
